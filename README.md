Fully implemented JS Panorma API for Dota 2 for Windows Platform

WARNING:I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BANS!!!!!!!!!!


## Installation

Windows:

```
1)You need to install Node.js first
2)Extract the zip file somewhere like on your Desktop
3)Copy the folder called corona and put it in your DOta 2 Steam game folder, example: C:Program File\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game
4)Edit gameinfo.gi (inside dota folder)
add this line inside Serach Paths like this:
SearchPaths
		{
			// These are optional language paths. They must be mounted first, which is why there are first in the list.
			// *LANGUAGE* will be replaced with the actual language name. If not running a specific language, these paths will not be mounted
			Game_Language		dota_*LANGUAGE*

			// These are optional low-violence paths. They will only get mounted if you're in a low-violence mode.
			Game_LowViolence	dota_lv
					
			Game				corona
			
				
			Game				dota
			Game				core

			Mod					dota

			AddonRoot			dota_addons

			// Note: addon content is included in publiccontent by default.
			PublicContent		dota_core
			PublicContent		core
		}
Make sure the vpk is on the latest version with Dota 2 (if depricated dota 2 will crash with hud error)
5)Build the scripts pressing Build.bat
6)After Building Scripts execute start.bat (should look like this bellow)
```

```
7)Open Dota 2 DEMO Match and Enjoy!
```
## Usage example

Make Sure that the Dota 2 Terminal is Open, Type in "bind Home __TogglePannel"

You can write more commands like this just press _ in Terminal and it will show all the available and implemented API commands and scripts

## GUI
This is the look of the Script when loaded:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5c5tRx0.png">


The GUI is very limited (it has only on/off button), only just a list of toggleable scripts
There is also Output log that informs about the script state

## IN PROGRESS
```
Working on adding slider and keybinder in the UI
```

## Developing New Scripts
You will need Visual Studio Code or other Text Editor
```
To Develop New Scripts:
1)Open the extracted folder, make sure src, Corona.ts and dota2.d.ts are inside using  Visual Studio Code
2)Start writing new body.ts file inside another folder for example src/testscript/body.ts
After developing just rerun build.bat
and start.bat
```

## FAQ
```
Q:I don't see the script menu
A:Make sure that gameinfo.gi points to the corona folder

Q:My game lags when I enable all the scripts
A:The scripts are not optimised for using them all of them at once, this includes Antiinitiation,AutoSteal,JugleMaphack,Last Hit.

Q:I see hud error, what can I do to fix it?
(Method Changed as of 2020)
A:Download Dota 2 Workshop Tools and rebuild the hud_reborn file.
1)Download GCFScape
2)Open pak-1_dir.vpk
(When copying hud_reborn.xml to the new file to compile inside workshop tools you need to place it into custom_game folder instead of the usual path)
3)Copy root/panorama/layout/hud/hud_reborn.vxml_c file
4)Open it with notepad++
5)Copy the contents inside script tags (FunctionInit())
6)Download new hud_reborn.xml file from github tracker for dota 2 and rebuild it with Workshop Tools
7)Rebuild the vpk file with vpk.exe builder (Serch it around google)
8)Replace the vpk
9)Start the scripts and dota 2
10)DONE
